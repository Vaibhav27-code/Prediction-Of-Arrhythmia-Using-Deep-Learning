# Prediction-Of-Arrhythmia-Using-Deep-Learning
This project predicts cardiac arrhythmia using a CNN model trained on ECG features like RR interval, P wave, QRS complex, T wave, and QT interval. A Flask-based web app enables real-time predictions and user authentication. The model ensures accurate classification of Normal vs Arrhythmia heart activity.
